# 🧠 Machine Learning Practicals
Welcome to my Machine Learning Practicals repository! This is a curated collection of hands-on projects and notebooks I worked on to build and strengthen my understanding of core Machine Learning concepts. Each practical is designed to implement key ML techniques using real datasets and standard libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and more.
